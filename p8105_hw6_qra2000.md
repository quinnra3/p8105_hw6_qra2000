## Problem 2

1.  Focus on a simple linear regression with tmax as the response with
    tmin and prcp as the predictors, and are interested in the
    distribution of two quantities estimated from these data:

r^2 log(β<sup>1∗β</sup>2)

2.  Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
    estimates of these two quantities.

3.  Plot the distribution of your estimates, and describe these in
    words.

4.  Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5%
    quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for r^2 and
    log(β<sup>0∗β</sup>1)

Load and tidy the Central Park weather data from class:

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2022-01-01",
    date_max = "2022-12-31") |>
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) |>
  select(name, id, everything())
```

    ## date created (size, mb): 2023-09-28 10:18:43.183258 (8.541)

    ## file min/max dates: 1869-01-01 / 2023-09-30

Now, fit linear regression to the data set.

``` r
weather_lm = weather_df |> lm(btw ~ tmax * tmin * prcp, data = weather_df)
```

## Problem 3

First, we load and clean the data for regression analysis and convert
the `babysex`, `frace`, and `mrace` variables to factor variables.

``` r
bwt_df = read.csv("./data/birthweight.csv") |> 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(case_when(babysex == 1 ~ "male",
                                  babysex == 2 ~ "female")),
    frace = as.factor(case_when(frace == 1 ~ "White",
                                frace == 2 ~ "Black",
                                frace == 3 ~ "Asian",
                                frace == 4 ~ "Puerto Rican",
                                frace == 8 ~ "Other",
                                frace == 9 ~ "Unknown")),
    mrace = as.factor(case_when(mrace == 1 ~ "White",
                                mrace == 2 ~ "Black",
                                mrace == 3 ~ "Asian",
                                mrace == 4 ~ "Puerto Rican",
                                mrace == 8 ~ "Other")))
```

Next, we propose a regression model based on a hypothesized structure
for the factors that underly birthweight. My variables of interest are:
family monthly income (in hundreds, rounded), average number of
cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy, mother’s weight gain during
pregnancy (pounds), and mother’s race.

We fit the simple linear regression to the dataset, summarize model
estimates, and plot the model residuals against fitted values.

``` r
fit_1 = lm(bwt ~ fincome + smoken + wtgain + mrace, data = bwt_df)

fit_1 |> broom::tidy() |> knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              | estimate | std.error | statistic | p.value |
|:------------------|---------:|----------:|----------:|--------:|
| (Intercept)       | 2862.820 |    73.499 |    38.950 |   0.000 |
| fincome           |    0.884 |     0.297 |     2.979 |   0.003 |
| smoken            |  -11.494 |     0.987 |   -11.650 |   0.000 |
| wtgain            |   11.582 |     0.646 |    17.936 |   0.000 |
| mraceBlack        | -171.461 |    71.805 |    -2.388 |   0.017 |
| mracePuerto Rican |  -46.764 |    77.014 |    -0.607 |   0.544 |
| mraceWhite        |  166.887 |    71.897 |     2.321 |   0.020 |

``` r
bwt_df |> 
  add_predictions(fit_1) |> 
  add_residuals(fit_1) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm", color = "red")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

The plot shows there is a symmetric distribution above and below the
line y = 0. This indicates that this is a normal distribution, so we
proceed with the linear regression analysis.

Next, we compare this model to two others: one using length at birth and
gestational age as predictors, and one using head circumference, length,
sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction) between
these. We will make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated
prediction error.

``` r
cv_df =
  crossv_mc(bwt_df, 100) |> 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble))

cv_df = 
  cv_df |> 
  mutate(
    fit_1 = map(train, \(df) lm(bwt ~ fincome * smoken * wtgain, data = df)),
    fit_2 = map(train, \(df) lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = df)),
    fit_3 = map(train, \(df) lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = df))) |> 
  mutate(
    rmse_fit_1 = map2_dbl(fit_1, test, \(mod, df) rmse(model = mod, data = df)),
    rmse_fit_2 = map2_dbl(fit_2, test, \(mod, df) rmse(model = mod, data = df)),
    rmse_fit_3 = map2_dbl(fit_3, test, \(mod, df) rmse(model = mod, data = df)))
```

Next, we will display the RMSE results.

``` r
cv_df |> 
  summarize(
    fit_1_mean_error = mean(rmse_fit_1),
    fit_2_mean_error = mean(rmse_fit_2),
    fit_3_mean_error = mean(rmse_fit_3)
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| fit_1_mean_error | fit_2_mean_error | fit_3_mean_error |
|-----------------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|
|          488.265 |          332.229 |          288.603 |

The plot below shows the RMSE results in a violin plot:

``` r
cv_df |> 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model",
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse ") |> 
  mutate(model = fct_inorder(model)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + 
  geom_violin()
```
